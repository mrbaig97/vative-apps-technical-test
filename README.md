Tasks
Tracing and Testing in Node.js
Tracing
Tracing involves monitoring the execution of your Node.js application to diagnose performance issues and debug problems. It's crucial because it allows developers to understand how different parts of the application interact and identify where bottlenecks or errors occur.

Test Pyramid
The test pyramid is a framework that represents different levels of testing. It emphasizes having more low-level unit tests than high-level end-to-end tests. Maintaining a balanced approach to testing ensures comprehensive coverage and efficiency.

Event-Driven Architecture and Scalability in Node.js
Clusters and Worker Threads
Clusters allow you to create multiple Node.js processes that can share the same server port, handling multiple concurrent requests efficiently. Worker threads provide a way to run JavaScript in parallel threads, useful for performing CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main event loop.

Strategies for Managing High Request Volume
Utilize the event loop and non-blocking I/O for handling many concurrent connections efficiently. Strategies include load balancing, caching, and rate limiting to manage high request volumes.

Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Functions
Asynchronous functions are non-blocking, allowing other operations to continue while they execute. Synchronous functions are blocking, halting the execution of the program until they complete. Asynchronous functions improve the scalability and responsiveness of an application.

Optimizing Performance with Worker Threads in Node.js
Worker threads are used to offload CPU-intensive tasks to separate threads, preventing the main thread from blocking. This improves performance for tasks like complex calculations.

Real-Time Communication with Sockets and Performance Optimization
WebSocket Server
A WebSocket server enables real-time communication between the server and clients. This is useful for applications that require instant updates.

Strategies for High Concurrent Connections
Use load balancing, efficient memory management, and scalable architecture to handle multiple connections efficiently.

Caching
Implement caching using tools like Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load. Use techniques like setting appropriate TTL (time-to-live) values to manage cache expiration.

Creating Unit Test Cases for a Login API with Validation
The Login API allows users to authenticate with a username and password. Unit tests ensure the functionality works as expected. Unit testing ensures reliability, helps detect bugs early, and facilitates refactoring.

Problem Solving: Roman to Integer
A function to convert Roman numerals to integers. This involves mapping Roman numeral characters to their integer values and handling specific rules for numeral combinations.
